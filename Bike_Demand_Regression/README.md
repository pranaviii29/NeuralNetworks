Bike Demand Prediction using Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a L-layer neural network from scratch (NumPy only) to predict bike demand.

 Dataset
- Hourly bike sharing data
- Target variable: `count`
- Features include weather, season, temperature, humidity, etc.

 Model
- L-layer Neural Network
- ReLU activations for hidden layers
- Linear activation for output layer
- Mean Squared Error loss
- Gradient Descent optimization

 Results
- Neural Network Test R² ≈ 0.96
- Linear Regression baseline included for comparison

 Skills Used
- Neural Networks from scratch
- Forward & Backward Propagation
- Data preprocessing & scaling
- Model evaluation (R²)
